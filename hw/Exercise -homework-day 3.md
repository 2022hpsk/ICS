## 4.1 

MEMORY :  Storage of information (data/program)

Processing Unit : Computation/Processing of Information

Input: Means of getting information into the computer.

Output: Means of getting information out of the computer. 

Control Unit: Makes sure that all the other parts perform their tasks correctly and at the correct time.



## 4.7

We need 6 bits for 60 opcodes, 5 bits for registers.

Thus there are 32-6-5*2=16 bits for IMM, the range is -2^15 ~ (2^15)-1.

that is -32768 ~ 32767
